# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
A middleware function has access to the request, response, and next objects (next is essentially a pointer to the next middleware function). Middleware functions take these objects and can perform the following tasks with them:

1. parse request bodies 
2. authenticating and authorizing
3. logging 
4. handling errors
5. modify the request/response objects

Middleware functions can run in both specific and global **routes**.

---

Controller functions, on the other hand, can only run within the context of a specific route. They handle all the logic and tasks that deal with an incoming response that will be received at a specific endpoint. They can perform the following tasks:

1. Extract data from a response object
2. Grabbing information from the server's database or third-party APIs to form a response 
3. Generating a response 

Controller functions only run when a request's route matches the route they're "tied" to.
