# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are unchanging files or elements rendered onto the frontend exactly as they are stored on the server. Things like constantly updating the time, updating location or status, etc. aren't possible with static assets. 

Static assets in React are merely the parts of the website you don't need to make dynamic (because they remain constant, for the most part) such as HTML, CSS, JS files, images, documents, etc. You can make an asset static by changing the file extension from .jsx to js.
