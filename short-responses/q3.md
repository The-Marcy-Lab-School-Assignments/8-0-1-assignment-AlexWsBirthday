# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are unchanging files or elements rendered onto the frontend exactly as they are stored on the server. Things like constantly updating the time, updating location or status, etc. aren't possible with static assets. 

Concerning static assets in a React project, I'm going to assume that you just push out the module as it is onto the DOM and you don't update it manually, if at all.
